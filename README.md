# [Project 1: Course to Job Matching System](https://github.com/michaelywang/NYCDSA-Capstone-Project)
Created an online course to job matching system by parsing over 20,000 web scraped job postings using NLP to identify professional skills and match them to over 4,500 courses. Used unsupervised learning to cluster jobs by descriptions (PCA, K-Means) and NLP techniques (TF-IDF, Word2Vec) to parse job and course descriptions and match the two on cosine similarity using the Google News corpus. 

# [Project 2: Webscraping Coursera](https://github.com/michaelywang/coursera-web-scraping)
Built a webcrawler using Scrapy framework to analyze data from 3,600 online courses and identify key factors in enrollment. Discovered potential areas for Coursera to expand given market opportunities, course offerings and student demand.

# [Project 3: Housing Price Prediction](https://github.com/michaelywang/Ames_House_Prices) 
Predicted housing prices in Ames, Iowa based on historical data. Built a Python pre-processing module to clean and merge data in preparation for model testing, expanded upon given features to practice feature engineering with external market forces (VIX, CPI) to improve prediction accuracy. Used cross validation techniques to tune hyperparameters and compared our penalized regression models (Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net) for the best result.    

# [Project 4: Fishery Conservation Dashboard (R-Shiny)](https://github.com/michaelywang/North-Atlantic-Fisheries-Shiny-App)
Constructed a time series analysis on the Northeast Atlantic fishing industry over 11 years. Presented findings in an interactive R Shiny dashboard using GoogleVis for data visualization.
